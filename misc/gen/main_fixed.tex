\chapter*{ABSTRACT}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{ABSTRACT}

Our project Blood Donor Information Management System is a comprehensive web-based application designed to centralize and manage detailed blood donor information for healthcare institutions. The system focuses on organizing comprehensive donor profiles, tracking health metrics, managing donation histories, and providing advanced search capabilities for donor information. Built on a centralized PostgreSQL database, it ensures secure storage and efficient retrieval of donor data with role-based authentication for administrators and donors.
\\\\
This information management platform enables administrators to access detailed donor databases, track comprehensive health metrics, monitor eligibility status with automated calculations, manage donor profiles with medical information, and generate analytical reports. Donors can maintain detailed personal and medical profiles, track their health metrics over time, view complete donation histories, and update their information. The Django-based system provides efficient donor information organization and management capabilities for modern healthcare institutions.

\chapter{INTRODUCTION}

\section{Background}
Healthcare institutions struggle with managing comprehensive donor information including medical records, health metrics, donation history, and eligibility tracking. Our Blood Donor Information Management System provides a centralized platform built with Django framework and PostgreSQL database to efficiently organize, store, and manage all donor-related information.In recent years, healthcare institutions have faced significant challenges in efficiently managing donor-related information such as medical history, health metrics, donation records, and eligibility tracking. Traditional paper-based systems and semi-digital solutions are often inefficient, error-prone, and difficult to scale, especially during emergencies when real-time data access is critical.\\\\
The Blood Donor Information Management System (BDIMS) has been developed as a response to these challenges. It is a centralized, web-based application built using the Django framework and PostgreSQL database. The system aims to streamline and digitize the entire donor information lifecycle—from registration and health tracking to donation history and emergency response coordination.\\\\
This platform empowers administrators with the tools to manage donor databases, monitor blood inventory, assess donor eligibility automatically, and respond quickly to urgent blood requests. Simultaneously, donors are provided with a user-friendly interface to maintain their profiles, update health details, track donation history, and find donation opportunities.\\\\
By modernizing donor data handling, the system significantly improves data accuracy, coordination efficiency, and overall reliability of blood donation services—contributing to better healthcare outcomes and faster emergency response.\\\\
The system focuses on comprehensive donor information management with detailed profile tracking, health metrics monitoring, automated eligibility calculations, and advanced search capabilities. Administrators can access complete donor databases, track health metrics, manage blood inventory, and generate detailed reports. Donors maintain detailed profiles with medical information, view comprehensive donation history, and receive personalized health tracking.
\\\\

\section{Problem Statement}
Healthcare institutions face significant challenges in managing comprehensive donor information including scattered medical records, manual health metrics tracking, inefficient donor search systems, and lack of centralized donor databases. Traditional paper-based systems cannot handle complex donor information requirements such as detailed health metrics, blood compatibility tracking, emergency contact management, and automated eligibility calculations. This creates inefficiencies in donor information retrieval, health monitoring, and emergency response coordination.
\\\\
\section{Objectives}
           The main objective of the project is to develop a user-friendly and efficient blood donor information management system that replaces traditional paper-based processes and enhances real-time coordination.

\chapter{LITERATURE REVIEW}

Blood Donor Information Management Systems (BDIMS) are critical for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of blood donation services. Globally, the transition from manual to digital systems has improved donor tracking, eligibility verification, and blood request coordination (Kumar \& Gupta, 2020). In Nepal, while many hospitals and Red Cross branches still rely on semi-digital or paper-based systems, there has been notable progress in adopting digital platforms, particularly in urban areas.
\\\\
A study by Sharma et al. (2019) showed that digital donor registries reduce administrative workload by over 30\% and improve response time during emergency blood shortages. In Nepal, organizations like Nepal Red Cross Society (NRCS) have begun piloting donor information systems in collaboration with local ICT firms. For instance, the NRCS Blood Transfusion Service in Kathmandu introduced a digital donor card system in 2021, which enabled quicker access to donor history and eligibility data.
\\\\
According to the Ministry of Health and Population (MoHP), around 300,000 units of blood are collected annually in Nepal, yet demand often exceeds supply due to poor coordination and lack of real-time data access, especially in remote areas. In 2022, the Hamro LifeBank project launched a mobile and web platform that connects hospitals, donors, and blood banks in real-time, helping reduce request response times from hours to minutes in the Kathmandu Valley. The platform also integrates GPS to show nearby donors and blood drives—an approach proven effective in donor mobilization during peak need.
\\\\
Usability-focused systems featuring role-based dashboards, automated SMS alerts, and one-click eligibility checks have been reported to increase donor retention rates by 20–25\% (Ali et al., 2022). Nepal’s use of QR-based donor ID cards and mobile notifications, though still in limited deployment, is aligned with this global trend and shows promise for improving traceability and engagement.
\\\\
However, Nepal continues to face challenges in system scalability, especially in rural regions. Limited internet access, low digital literacy, and lack of staff training hinder broader adoption. Research by Yadav \& Mehta (2020) recommends focusing on offline-first mobile apps and decentralized data storage solutions for improving nationwide coverage.
\\\\
In conclusion, literature and local data both indicate that Blood Donor Information Management Systems are vital for enhancing Nepal’s blood donation services. Projects like Hamro LifeBank and NRCS digital initiatives highlight the transformative potential of these systems, though further investment in infrastructure, training, and scalability is needed for long-term sustainability and national reach.
