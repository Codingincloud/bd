INTRODUCTION

1.1 Background
Healthcare institutions struggle with managing comprehensive donor information including 
medical records, health metrics, donation history, and eligibility tracking. Our Blood Donor 
Information Management System provides a centralized platform built with Django framework 
and PostgreSQL database to efficiently organize, store, and manage all donor-related information.

In recent years, healthcare institutions have faced significant challenges in efficiently managing 
donor-related information such as medical history, health metrics, donation records, and 
eligibility tracking. Traditional paper-based systems and semi-digital solutions are often 
inefficient, error-prone, and difficult to scale, especially during emergencies when real-time data 
access is critical.

The Blood Donor Information Management System (BDIMS) has been developed as a response 
to these challenges. It is a centralized, web-based application built using the Django framework 
and PostgreSQL database. The system aims to streamline and digitize the entire donor 
information lifecycle—from registration and health tracking to donation history and emergency 
response coordination.

This platform empowers administrators with the tools to manage donor databases, monitor blood 
inventory, assess donor eligibility automatically, and respond quickly to urgent blood requests. 
Simultaneously, donors are provided with a user-friendly interface to maintain their profiles, 
update health details, track donation history, and find donation opportunities.

By modernizing donor data handling, the system significantly improves data accuracy, 
coordination efficiency, and overall reliability of blood donation services—contributing to better 
healthcare outcomes and faster emergency response.

The system focuses on comprehensive donor information management with detailed profile 
tracking, health metrics monitoring, automated eligibility calculations, and advanced search 
capabilities. Administrators can access complete donor databases, track health metrics, manage 
blood inventory, and generate detailed reports. Donors maintain detailed profiles with medical 
information, view comprehensive donation history, and receive personalized health tracking.

1.2 Problem Statement
Current blood donor management practices in healthcare institutions, particularly those relying 
on traditional manual or decentralized paper-based systems, are fraught with critical 
inefficiencies. These systems inherently result in scattered, non-standardized donor medical 
records and the manual tracking of complex health metrics. This decentralized approach 
critically undermines data integrity and makes comprehensive donor oversight impossible. The 
lack of a single, efficient, and centralized donor database creates inefficient response and 
retrieval including operational inefficiency.

1.3 Objectives
The main objective of the project is to:

• Develop and implement a robust, secure, and user-friendly "Blood Donor Information 
  Management System" that centralizes donor records, automates eligibility checks, and 
  facilitates real-time emergency coordination to replace inefficient paper-based processes 
  and enhance the safety and efficiency of blood donation management.

LITERATURE REVIEW

Blood Donor Information Management Systems have emerged as critical components of modern 
healthcare infrastructure. This review examines existing research and implementations globally, 
with emphasis on developing countries like Nepal.

2.1 Evolution of Blood Donation Management Systems
Kumar and Gupta (2020) documented three distinct phases of evolution:
1. Manual Phase: Paper-based registers with limited search capabilities
2. Basic Digital Phase: Spreadsheets and standalone databases
3. Modern Phase: Comprehensive web-based systems with real-time coordination

Research by Sharma et al. (2019) found that digital donor registries reduced administrative 
workload by over 30% and improved emergency response times by approximately 45%. In Nepal, 
there has been notable progress in adopting digital platforms, particularly in urban areas.

2.2 Blood Donation Landscape in Nepal
According to the Ministry of Health and Population (2022), approximately 300,000 units of blood 
are collected annually in Nepal, yet demand often exceeds supply. The Nepal Red Cross Society 
(NRCS) has been progressively modernizing operations, introducing digital donor cards in 2021.

The Hamro LifeBank project (launched 2022) represents a significant milestone, reducing 
emergency response times from 3.5 hours to 45 minutes in the Kathmandu Valley. The platform 
registered over 15,000 donors by end of 2023.

2.3 Global Best Practices
Research by Ali et al. (2022) identified key best practices:
• User-Centric Design: 20-25% higher donor retention rates
• Mobile Accessibility: 40% higher engagement rates
• Automated Communication: 55% increase in emergency response rates
• Gamification: 32% increase in repeat donations over two years

2.4 Technology Frameworks
Martinez et al. (2021) compared web frameworks for healthcare applications, finding Django 
superior in security features, administrative interface, and database ORM capabilities. 
PostgreSQL's ACID compliance and query optimization make it ideal for healthcare data 
requiring integrity.

2.5 Eligibility Criteria and Medical Guidelines
WHO guidelines establish international standards including:
• Age: 18-65 years
• Weight: Minimum 45kg (Nepal context), WHO recommends 50kg
• Hemoglobin: 12.5 g/dL (women), 13.0 g/dL (men)
• Inter-donation interval: 56 days (8 weeks)
• Blood pressure: Systolic 100-180 mmHg, Diastolic 60-100 mmHg

Anderson et al. (2019) found automated eligibility checking detected 12% more temporary 
deferrals compared to manual screening.

2.6 Gap Analysis
Despite significant progress globally, gaps remain particularly relevant to Nepal:
• Limited research on context-specific solutions for resource-constrained environments
• Insufficient guidance on integration with existing healthcare infrastructure
• Need for culturally adapted systems addressing local donation practices
